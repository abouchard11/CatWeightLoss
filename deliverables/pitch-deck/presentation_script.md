## Slide 1: Title Slide

- **Time:** 45 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Introduce the product and its core value proposition of brand engagement without liability.

**Script:**

*(Start with a confident, welcoming posture. Let the slide build for a moment.)*

"Good morning. Thank you for your time. We're here today to talk about the single biggest missed opportunity in the pet food industry: the post-purchase black hole. What happens after your customer walks out the door?"

*(Pause for effect.)*

"We've created **Cat Weight Companion**, a white-label application designed specifically to solve that problem. It's a tool that puts *your* brand in your customer's pocket, creating a direct line of engagement long after the sale."

"The tagline on the screen says it all, and it's the theme for this entire presentation: **Your brand. Your customers. Zero liability.** Over the next ten minutes, I'm going to show you exactly what that means."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Make eye contact with key decision-makers
- Speak clearly and deliberately. Use the tagline as a powerful, anchoring statement

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

- **Time:** 60 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Establish the core business challenges that the app solves.

**Script:**

"So, let's define the problem. Your bag goes home... then what? Right now, the customer relationship ends at the point of sale."

*(Gesture to the first point on the slide.)*

"There's **no engagement**. You have no idea if they're using the food correctly, if their cat is responding well, or if they're even still a customer. There's **no data**. And there's **no proof** that your premium weight management formula is actually working."

"And the entire time, your competitor is just one aisle away, ready to be picked up on the next shopping trip. You've spent years building a premium brand, but you have zero signal from post-purchase."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Use a slightly more urgent, problem-oriented tone
- Keep the pace moving to reflect the series of challenges

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

- **Time:** 45 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Present the simple, three-step solution.

**Script:**

"Our solution is elegantly simple, and it's designed to fit seamlessly into your existing customer's journey."

*(Point to each step on the diagram as you speak.)*

"It starts with a **QR code** on your packaging. The customer scans it with their phone. This immediately launches a **branded app**—with your colors, your logo, your product name. From there, you get **aggregate engagement data**: how many people scanned, how many completed setup, how engaged they remain over time."

"It's a closed loop that turns every bag of food into a direct marketing channel."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Use your hands to trace the flow on the slide
- Keep the explanation concise—save details for later slides

---

## Slide 4: 90-Second Experience

- **Time:** 60 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Emphasize the frictionless user experience.

**Script:**

"Now, let's talk about what the customer actually experiences. This is critical because user adoption is everything."

*(Walk through each step.)*

"**Scan**: 5 seconds. They point their phone at the QR code on the bag. **Brand Splash**: 10 seconds. Your logo, your colors, a simple 'Get Started' button. **Quick Setup**: 30 seconds. Cat's name, current weight, target weight. That's it. **Track Weight**: 45 seconds. They enter the first data point."

"Total time? Under 90 seconds from scan to value."

*(Emphasize the bottom points.)*

"And here's the key: **No login. No email. No friction.** We request zero permissions. This isn't a social media platform trying to harvest data. It's a utility that helps them track their cat's progress while keeping them connected to your brand."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Use a friendly, almost demonstrative tone—like you're showing a product demo
- The "no login, no email" points should feel like a relief to the audience

---

## Slide 5: Brand Ownership

- **Time:** 45 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Reassure clients that they maintain complete brand control.

**Script:**

"I want to be absolutely clear about what 'white-label' means for you."

*(Read through each point with emphasis.)*

"**Your brand name**—prominently displayed everywhere. **Your brand colors**—throughout every screen of the UI. **Your product name**—directly tied to every metric we track. **Your calorie data**—used for the portion calculations."

"We build the technology. You own the entire customer experience."

*(Point to the footer.)*

"There's no 'Powered by' badge. No co-branding. When the customer uses this app, they think it's *your* app. Because it is."

**Delivery Notes:**
- This slide is about reassurance
- Maintain confident eye contact with brand-focused stakeholders (CMOs, VPs of Marketing)

---

## Slide 6: Engagement Metrics

- **Time:** 60 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Show the valuable, actionable data that brands will receive.

**Script:**

"So what do you get in return? Engagement metrics. Anonymized, aggregated, and directly tied to your brand and product SKUs."

*(Go through the table.)*

"**Total QR Activations**: How many people scanned? This is your campaign reach. **Setup Completion Rate**: Of those who scanned, how many finished onboarding? This tells you about funnel health. **Average Opens Per Week**: How sticky is the app? Are people coming back? **Users with 3+ Entries**: These are your retained, engaged users. This is product validation. **Average Progress Bucket**: Are users trending toward their goals? This is your efficacy signal."

*(Emphasize the footer.)*

"All of this data is grouped by *your* brand ID and *your* SKU. You can see which products drive the most engagement."

**Delivery Notes:**
- This is a data-heavy slide; keep your pace steady
- The table format helps—point to rows as you discuss them

---

## Slide 7: What We Don't Measure

- **Time:** 75 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Begin the risk mitigation section by explaining deliberate exclusions.

**Script:**

*(Slight pause before this slide—this is a transition point.)*

"Now, we're going to shift gears. For the next few slides, I want to talk to your legal and compliance teams. Because what we *don't* do is just as important as what we do."

*(Read the exclusions with brief explanations.)*

"We **don't measure actual weight values**. Why? Medical liability. We don't want to know if a cat weighs 12 pounds or 15 pounds. We only track relative progress—is it going up, down, or stable?"

"We **don't track individual user journeys**. Why? Privacy. We can't identify any specific person or pet."

"We **don't measure feeding compliance**. Why? Blame risk. We have no idea if the user is following portions correctly, and we don't want to."

"We **don't report goal achievement rates**. Why? Outcome promise. We never claim that your food will make a cat lose weight."

*(Deliver the punchline with emphasis.)*

"**We don't know if your food worked. That's the point.** You get engagement signal. Not liability exposure."

**Delivery Notes:**
- This is the most important slide for legal stakeholders
- The final line should land with impact—pause slightly before and after

---

## Slide 8: Zero Liability Design

- **Time:** 60 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Detail the specific safety guardrails built into the product.

**Script:**

"Let me walk you through the design choices that make this possible."

*(Go through each point.)*

"**No 'recommended' language—anywhere.** The word 'recommended' does not appear in the app. Period. We calculate, we don't advise."

"**No outcome promises.** We never say 'you will lose' or 'your cat will reach goal.' We show a trend. That's it."

"**No feeding instructions.** The user enters their own portion data. We don't tell them what to feed."

"**No medical claims.** This is a log, not a health app. We're a digital notebook, not a veterinarian."

"**No data off-device.** There's nothing to breach because nothing leaves the phone."

*(Point to the highlighted box.)*

"And finally, **weight loss is capped in code**. 2% per week maximum, 30% total maximum. These limits are hardcoded and cannot be overridden, even by us."

*(Deliver with confidence.)*

"Your legal team will clear this in one meeting."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Keep a confident, matter-of-fact tone
- The "one meeting" line should feel like a promise

---

## Slide 9: Scope Is Frozen

- **Time:** 60 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Define product boundaries as a feature, not a limitation.

**Script:**

"Now I want to address something that might come up later: 'Can we add features?'"

"The answer is: this is not a roadmap. This is a deliverable."

*(Gesture to the grid of exclusions.)*

"No user accounts. No push notifications. No cloud sync. No multiple cats. No vet integration. No food ordering. No social features. No widgets."

"These are not 'coming soon.' These are **permanently out of scope** for this product."

*(Explain the rationale.)*

"Why? Because every one of those features introduces complexity, cost, or risk. We've made a deliberate choice to keep this product simple, focused, and defensible."

"If you want any of those features in the future, it's a separate statement of work with its own legal review. But this core product? Frozen."

*(Deliver with emphasis.)*

"**No surprise costs. No feature creep.** Procurement will love this slide."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Acknowledge that this might seem limiting, but frame it as a strength
- The "Procurement loves this" line should get a knowing nod

---

## Slide 10: Data Stays on Device

- **Time:** 45 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Explain the privacy-by-design architecture.

**Script:**

"Finally, let's talk about where the data lives."

*(Point to the diagram.)*

"All cat data—every weight entry, every log—stays right here on the user's iPhone. It is never transmitted to any server. Not ours, not yours, not anyone's."

"The data auto-purges after 90 days. There's nothing to subpoena. Nothing to breach."

*(Summarize the benefits.)*

"This means: **No servers** for us to maintain or you to worry about. **No breach risk.** **No GDPR headaches.**"

"The QR code creates context—it tells the app which brand and product launched it—but it doesn't create surveillance. We have no idea who the users are."

*(Finish with the tagline.)*

"Your Security team can verify this in 10 minutes by looking at the Info.plist. There are no network permissions."

**Delivery Notes:**
- This slide is short and should feel conclusive
- Security-focused stakeholders will appreciate the technical specificity

---

## Slide 11: The One-Liner

- **Time:** 30 Seconds
- **Key Message:** Provide the simple packaging copy.

**Script:**

*(Let the slide speak for itself for a moment.)*

"Here it is. Eleven words."

*(Read it slowly, deliberately.)*

"**'Scan this to track your cat's weight with the food you just bought.'**"

"That's the entire store associate training. That's the entire shelf card. That's the entire value proposition."

"If your field team can't explain it in one sentence, it won't work. They can."

**Delivery Notes:**
- This is a moment of simplicity—let the quote breathe
- The "eleven words" callout emphasizes just how simple the messaging is

---

## Slide 12: Next Steps

- **Time:** 60 Seconds + Q&A
- **Key Message:** Outline the clear path forward and open for questions.

**Script:**

"So, where do we go from here?"

*(Walk through the steps.)*

"**Step 1: Legal Review.** We hand off the QR Contract—that's Document B in your materials—to your counsel. They review the liability architecture."

"**Step 2: Brand Setup.** Once legal is comfortable, you send us your brand name, your hex colors, and your SKU and calorie data. Simple intake form."

"**Step 3: QR Generation.** We provide test QR codes for your team to validate."

"**Step 4: Pilot.** We launch with a limited SKU—one product line, one region. We collect engagement data and prove the model."

"**Step 5: Rollout.** Based on pilot results, we expand to your full product line."

*(Summarize the timeline.)*

"The typical timeline from legal review to live pilot is 8-12 weeks. Legal first. Everything else is downstream."

*(Open for questions.)*

"And with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions. What can I clarify for you?"

**Delivery Notes:**
- This is a call to action—be direct and confident
- Be prepared for questions, especially from legal and procurement
