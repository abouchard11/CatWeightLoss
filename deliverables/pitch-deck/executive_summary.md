# Executive Summary: Cat Weight Companion

**To:** Interested Stakeholders
**From:** Cat Weight Companion Team
**Date:** January 10, 2026
**Subject:** A Zero-Liability Customer Engagement Tool for Pet Food Brands

---

## The Opportunity

The relationship between pet food brands and their customers ends at the point of sale. This creates a post-purchase "black hole" with no data on product usage, no proof of efficacy for weight management formulas, and no mechanism to build brand loyalty. **Cat Weight Companion** is a white-label iOS application designed to bridge this gap, turning every bag of food into a direct-to-consumer engagement channel.

---

## The Solution

A QR code placed on product packaging allows customers to instantly launch a fully-branded application on their iPhone. The entire onboarding process takes 90 seconds and is designed to be frictionless, requiring **no login, no email, and no password**. This ensures maximum user adoption and provides brands with a continuous touchpoint to measure engagement.

## The "Zero Liability" Architecture: A Risk-Free Platform

The core of our product is a meticulously designed architecture that insulates your brand from medical, privacy, and scope-related risks.

| Risk Category | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Medical Liability** | The app **never** collects or stores actual weight values (e.g., lbs/kg). It only tracks relative progress, preventing any classification as a medical or diagnostic tool. |
| **Data Privacy & Security** | All data is stored **exclusively on the user's device** and is never transmitted to any server. With no central database, there is no risk of a data breach and no GDPR compliance burden. |
| **Scope & Budget Creep** | The product has a **frozen scope**. Features like user accounts, cloud sync, social sharing, and vet integration are permanently excluded. Any future additions require a separate SOW and legal review. |

## The Value Proposition for Your Brand

While insulating you from risk, Cat Weight Companion delivers significant value by providing access to aggregate, anonymized engagement data:

- **Customer Activation:** How many users are scanning the QR code and engaging with the brand post-purchase.
- **Product Stickiness:** How many users are tracking progress over multiple weeks, indicating sustained usage and loyalty.
- **Onboarding Success:** A clear view of the setup completion rate, proving the effectiveness of the frictionless experience.

This data allows you to prove the value of your marketing spend and gain a competitive advantage in the pet food industry.

## Next Steps: A Turnkey Implementation

Cat Weight Companion is a finished marketing deliverable, not a complex IT project. The path to launch is simple:

1. **Legal Review:** Your team validates our zero-liability architecture.
2. **Brand Setup:** We integrate your brand assets and product data.
3. **Pilot Program:** A limited market test to validate engagement metrics.

The entire process from legal review to a live pilot can be completed in **8-12 weeks**.
