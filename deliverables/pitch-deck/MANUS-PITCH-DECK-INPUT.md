# SLIDE CONTENT

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE

**Title:** CAT WEIGHT COMPANION

**Subtitle:** White-Label App for Pet Food Brands

**Tagline (centered, emphasized):**
"Your brand. Your customers. Zero liability."

**Visual:** Placeholder for client logo

**Speaker notes:** This is not an app pitch. This is an engagement layer for your existing product.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Headline:** YOUR BAG GOES HOME. THEN WHAT?

**Bullet points (with X icons):**
- No engagement after purchase
- No data on product usage
- No proof your food works
- Competitor is one aisle away

**Footer text:** Premium food. Zero post-purchase signal.

**Speaker notes:** You sell a $60 bag. You have no idea if it worked. Neither does the customer.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

**Headline:** QR CODE → BRANDED APP → DATA

**Visual flow diagram (3 boxes with arrows):**
```
[QR ON BAG] → [YOUR BRANDED APP] → [ENGAGEMENT METRICS]
```

**Footer text:** Customer scans → Tracks their cat → You see trends

**Speaker notes:** One QR. Your brand. Their cat. Your data.

---

## SLIDE 4: WHAT THE CUSTOMER SEES

**Headline:** 90-SECOND EXPERIENCE

**Visual flow (4 boxes with timing):**
```
[SCAN QR - 5s] → [YOUR BRAND SPLASH - 10s] → [QUICK SETUP - 30s] → [TRACK WEIGHT - 45s]
```

**Footer points (with checkmarks):**
- No login
- No email
- No friction

**Speaker notes:** Under 60 seconds from scan to value. Zero permissions requested.

---

## SLIDE 5: WHAT YOU GET

**Headline:** BRAND OWNERSHIP

**Bullet points (with checkmarks):**
- Your brand name — prominently displayed
- Your brand colors — throughout UI
- Your product name — tied to every metric
- Your calorie data — used for portion math

**Key message:** We build it. You own the experience.

**Footer:** No "Powered by" badge. No co-branding.

**Speaker notes:** Customer thinks this is YOUR app. Because it is.

---

## SLIDE 6: WHAT YOU MEASURE

**Headline:** ENGAGEMENT METRICS (ANONYMOUS)

**Two-column table:**

| METRIC | WHY IT MATTERS |
|--------|----------------|
| Total QR Activations | Campaign reach |
| Setup Completion Rate | Funnel health |
| Avg Opens/Week | Stickiness |
| Users with 3+ Entries | Retained users |
| Avg Progress Bucket | Efficacy signal |

**Footer:** All data grouped by YOUR brand ID and SKU.

**Speaker notes:** You know how many customers engaged. Not who they are.

---

## SLIDE 7: WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE

*[BEGIN RISK MITIGATION SECTION — subtle visual differentiation]*

**Headline:** INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

**Bullet points (with X icons and explanations):**
- Actual weight values → Medical liability
- Individual user journeys → Privacy
- Feeding compliance → Blame risk
- Goal achievement rate → Outcome promise

**Emphasized text block:**
WE DON'T KNOW IF YOUR FOOD WORKED.
THAT'S THE POINT.

**Footer:** You get engagement signal. Not liability exposure.

**Speaker notes:** This is the slide that makes Legal smile.

---

## SLIDE 8: ZERO LIABILITY DESIGN

**Headline:** LEGAL-SAFE BY DESIGN

**Bullet points (with checkmarks):**
- No "recommended" language — anywhere
- No outcome promises — no "you will lose"
- No feeding instructions — user enters their own
- No medical claims — it's a log, not advice
- No data off-device — nothing to breach

**Highlighted box:**
Weight loss capped: 2%/week max, 30% total max
(Enforced in code — cannot be overridden)

**Call-out:** YOUR LEGAL TEAM WILL CLEAR THIS IN ONE MEETING.

**Speaker notes:** We designed for your Legal team first. Everything else followed.

---

## SLIDE 9: SCOPE IS FROZEN

**Headline:** WHAT YOU'RE NOT BUYING

**Two-column grid of exclusions (X icons):**
- User accounts / Push notifications
- Cloud sync / Multiple cats
- Vet integration / Food ordering
- Social features / Widgets

**Key message:** This is not a roadmap. This is a deliverable.

**Sub-message:** Any additions = separate SOW + legal review.

**Footer:** NO SURPRISE COSTS. NO FEATURE CREEP.

**Speaker notes:** Procurement loves this slide. Read it to them slowly.

---

## SLIDE 10: PRIVACY POSITION

**Headline:** DATA STAYS ON DEVICE

**Visual: Nested box diagram**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  USER'S iPHONE              │
│  ┌───────────────────────┐  │
│  │ All cat data here     │  │
│  │ Never transmitted     │  │
│  │ 90-day auto-purge     │  │
│  └───────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Footer points:**
- No servers
- No breach risk
- No GDPR headaches

**Tagline:** QR creates context, not surveillance.

**Speaker notes:** Your Security team can verify in 10 minutes. Info.plist has no network permissions.

*[END RISK MITIGATION SECTION]*

---

## SLIDE 11: THE ONE-LINER

**Large centered quote:**
"Scan this to track your cat's weight with the food you just bought."

**Subtitle:** — 11 words —

**Supporting text:**
- That's the entire store associate training.
- That's the entire shelf card.
- That's the entire value prop.

**Speaker notes:** If your field team can't explain it in one sentence, it won't work. They can.

---

## SLIDE 12: NEXT STEPS

**Headline:** READY TO MOVE?

**Numbered flow (vertical):**

1. **LEGAL REVIEW**
   Your counsel reviews QR Contract (Document B)
   ↓
2. **BRAND SETUP**
   Send us: Brand name, Hex colors, SKU + calorie data
   ↓
3. **QR GENERATION**
   We provide test QR codes
   ↓
4. **PILOT**
   Limited SKU launch
   ↓
5. **ROLLOUT**
   Full product line

**Footer:** Timeline: Legal → Brand → QR → Pilot

**Speaker notes:** Legal first. Everything else is downstream.

---

## APPENDIX SLIDE: OBJECTION RESPONSES (HIDDEN)

**Headline:** PRE-ANSWERED OBJECTIONS

**Q&A format:**

**"Does this create new claims?"**
→ No. QR transmits facts already on the bag.

**"What if someone sues over a weight trend?"**
→ Chart is a log. User entered data. No causal language.

**"Why can't we add our marketing message?"**
→ Claims create liability. Bag tells story, app proves engagement.

**"What's the ongoing cost?"**
→ Deliverable, not subscription. No servers = no hosting.

**"What if the app recommends feeding amounts?"**
→ It doesn't. Word "recommended" doesn't exist in app.

**Speaker notes:** Keep this slide hidden. Pull it out only if needed.
