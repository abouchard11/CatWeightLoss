# CAT WEIGHT COMPANION

### Turn Weight Management Packaging Into a Retention Engine

---

</div>

## The Problem

**Your customer relationship ends at checkout.**

Every bag of weight management cat food that leaves the store represents a lost opportunity. No engagement. No proof of efficacy. No data. No loyalty mechanism. Your competitors are about to solve this. Will you be first—or second?

---

## The Solution

**A QR code on your packaging. 90 seconds to engagement.**

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   SCAN QR   │  →   │  INSTANT    │  →   │   TRACK     │  →   │  ENGAGED    │
│   ON BAG    │      │   INSTALL   │      │  PROGRESS   │      │  CUSTOMER   │
│             │      │  (One tap)  │      │             │      │             │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

Customer scans → App launches instantly with **your brand, your colors, your products** → They track their cat's weight management journey → You get engagement data.

**One-tap install via QR. No account creation. No friction.**

## The Metrics That Matter
