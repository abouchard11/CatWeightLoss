VETERINARY-BASED CALCULATIONS

Our portion recommendations use industry-standard formulas for calculating Resting Energy Requirements (RER) and Maintenance Energy Requirements (MER). These are the same calculations veterinarians use to determine appropriate calorie intake for cats at different life stages and activity levels.

PRIVACY FIRST

Your cat's health data is private. We don't require account creation, and your tracking data stays on your device. Optional iCloud sync keeps your data backed up and synced across your Apple devices—still under your control.

GET STARTED TODAY

Download Cat Weight Tracker and take the first step toward better health monitoring for your feline friend. Whether your cat needs to lose a little weight, maintain their current healthy weight, or you simply want to track trends over time, this app makes it simple.

Note: This app is a tracking tool to help you monitor your cat's weight and feeding. Always consult with your veterinarian before making changes to your cat's diet or starting any weight management program. The calculations provided are based on general veterinary formulas and should not replace professional veterinary advice.

## 6. Secondary Category (Optional)

**Recommended:**
```
Lifestyle
```

If primary is Health & Fitness, Lifestyle as secondary captures broader pet care audience.

## Notes

**Health Claims Avoidance:**
All copy frames the app as a "tracking tool" or "monitoring tool"—never as a weight loss program or medical intervention. This reduces App Review risk.

**Keyword Optimization:**
Primary keywords focus on "cat," "weight," "tracker," "pet," and "health." Avoided "loss" in keywords to prevent health claim associations.

**Privacy-First Positioning:**
Emphasized local storage and no-account-required to appeal to privacy-conscious users and align with Apple's privacy values.

**Veterinary Authority:**
Referenced veterinary formulas (RER/MER) to establish credibility without making medical claims.

**White-Label Readiness:**
Metadata is generic and makes no brand-specific claims, allowing this listing to coexist with white-labeled versions distributed through enterprise channels.
