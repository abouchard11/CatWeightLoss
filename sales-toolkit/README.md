## Pricing Strategy

### Design Partner / Pilot Pricing
- **Setup Fee:** $0 (waived)
- **Per-Activation Fee:** $2-5 per activation (negotiate based on brand size)
- **Term:** 90 days, either party can walk away
- **Minimum Commitment:** $0 (pay only for activations)

### Post-Pilot Pricing (Framework)
- **Option A:** Setup fee ($5-10K) + per-activation fee ($3-4)
- **Option B:** Monthly SaaS ($2-5K/month) + overages
- **Option C:** Rev-share on affiliate commissions (10-20%)

### Negotiation Ranges
- Small brands (<$5M revenue): $2-3 per activation
- Mid brands ($5-20M revenue): $3-4 per activation
- Large brands (>$20M revenue): $4-5 per activation

**Rationale:** Larger brands have higher customer LTV, can afford higher per-activation cost.

## Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

### "We don't have budget for this"
**Response:** "That's why the pilot structure works. $0 upfront. You pay only per activation. If 500 customers activate at $4 each, that's $2,000 total. If those customers generate 15% reorder lift, you're ROI-positive in the pilot period."

### "We already have an app" / "We're building an app"
**Response:** "Great! How are you getting customers to download it? Most brands struggle with app adoption because customers have to download before they've tried the product. Our QR-on-packaging model solves that—the app comes with the product, not before."

### "How do I know this will work?"
**Response:** "You don't—that's why we're doing pilots. 90 days, minimal cost, you own all the data. If it doesn't hit the success metrics we agree on, walk away. If it works, scale it."

### "We need case studies"
**Response:** "You'd be a design partner, which means you're helping us build those case studies. In exchange, you get the most aggressive pricing and input on product roadmap. First-mover advantage."

### "Our customers won't scan QR codes"
**Response:** "Fair concern. That's what we're testing. But consider: every restaurant now has QR menus post-COVID. Pet owners are tech-savvy. And if the value prop is clear (track your cat's health, get easy reorders), they'll scan. Let's find out in the pilot."

### "What about Android?"
**Response:** "iOS first because 60% of premium pet food buyers are on iPhone. Android is on the roadmap for Q2/Q3. We can prioritize it for your brand if Android penetration is high in your customer base."

### "This seems too cheap to be real"
**Response:** "It's cheap because it's a pilot and we need design partners. We're subsidizing the cost to prove the model. Post-pilot pricing is higher, but still ROI-positive based on the reorder lift we're seeing."

### "What if we want to bring this in-house later?"
**Response:** "Totally fair. The LOI includes exit terms. You can export all customer data. We can discuss IP buyout if you want to own the white-label instance outright. We're not trying to lock you in—we're trying to prove value."

## Email Sending Best Practices

### Timing
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times:** 9-11am or 2-4pm (recipient's timezone)
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

### Personalization
- Reference something specific about the brand (recent funding, product launch, competitor move)
- Use their first name, not "Hi there" or "Dear Sir/Madam"
- Send from a real email address (you@catweightloss.com, not noreply@)

### Technical Setup
- Use plain text or minimally-formatted HTML (avoid heavy templates)
- Keep emails under 150 words for first touch
- Include email signature with photo, title, phone number
- Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC to avoid spam filters

### Tracking
- Use Mailchimp, HubSpot, or Superhuman for open/click tracking
- Set calendar reminders for follow-ups (don't rely on memory)
- Tag prospects in CRM with status: Cold, Responded, Demo Scheduled, Pilot Agreed, etc.

- Address objections.

**[14-15 min] Next Steps**
