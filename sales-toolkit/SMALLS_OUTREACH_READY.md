## PRIMARY TARGET: Matt Michaelson (CEO)

**LinkedIn:** Search "Matt Michaelson Smalls" on LinkedIn
**Email Pattern:** matt@smalls.com (confirm via Hunter.io or LinkedIn)

### Email 1 (Send First)

**Subject:** 80% retention is great. What about the 20%?

---

Hi Matt,

Saw your Mud Bay expansion hit 60+ stores in the Pacific Northwest. That's a big bet on retail for a DTC-native brand.

Here's what I've been thinking about: You've built something rare—95% of your 2-year customers stick around at the 3-year mark. Most subscription brands would kill for those numbers.

But what about the other 5%? Or the customers who churn in year one? Right now, once that box leaves your fulfillment center, you're essentially blind until they reorder (or don't).

**We built something for this exact gap.**

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers scan, track their cat's weight, and get smart reorder reminders tied to actual consumption—not arbitrary subscription cycles. Every reorder flows through your affiliate link.

Think of it as turning every Smalls bag into an ongoing customer relationship instead of a one-way delivery.

We're selecting 3 premium brands for our design partner program in Q1. Given your retention numbers and the retail expansion, Smalls seems like the obvious fit.

**Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?**

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — Design partners get $0 setup and pay only per app activation. We're closing selection by [DATE]. Farmer's Dog is watching this space—figured you'd want first mover advantage in cat.

## SECONDARY TARGET: Melody Park (Director, Brand Marketing)

**LinkedIn:** Search "Melody Park Smalls" on LinkedIn
**Email Pattern:** melody@smalls.com (confirm via Hunter.io)

### Alternate Version for Marketing Lead

**Subject:** What happens between Smalls deliveries?

---

Hi Melody,

I've been following Smalls' expansion into Mud Bay—60+ stores is a strong retail push for a DTC-first brand.

Quick thought: In your direct channel, you own the customer relationship from purchase to reorder. In retail, Mud Bay owns it. The customer buys Smalls, but you have no idea who they are or when they'll buy again.

We built a way to close that gap.

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code—on every bag, DTC or retail. Customers scan, track their cat's weight, and get smart reorder reminders tied to actual consumption. You get the customer relationship back.

We're working with 3 brands in Q1. Would Smalls want to be the first cat-focused brand in the program?

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

### Day 3 - Bump (if no response)

**Subject:** Re: 80% retention is great. What about the 20%?

[NAME] — Quick bump on this. The core insight: You're spending to acquire customers, then losing visibility until they hopefully reorder.

What if every Smalls bag became a retention tool?

Here's the one-pager: [ONE_PAGER_LINK]

15 minutes?

### Day 7 - Different Angle (if no response)

**Subject:** Retail expansion creates a customer data gap

[NAME] — I've been thinking about Smalls' Mud Bay launch.

In DTC, you own the customer relationship. In retail, Mud Bay owns it. The customer buys Smalls, but you have no idea who they are or when they'll buy again.

What if every bag—DTC or retail—connected customers directly to your brand via a QR code?

That's what we're building. Three brands are piloting in Q1.

Interested in being the cat-first brand that owns this space?

### Day 14 - Break-up (if no response)

**Subject:** Closing the loop on Smalls

[NAME] — I'll take the silence as "not the right time."

Before I close the loop: We're finalizing design partner selection this week. Smalls would be the first cat-focused brand in the program.

$0 setup. Per-activation pricing. 90-day pilot. Walk away if it doesn't work.

If this isn't a fit, totally understood. If you want to explore, I'll hold a spot through Friday.

## OBJECTION RESPONSES

**"We already have strong retention"**
> That's exactly why this works. You've proven customers love Smalls. This just gives them a reason to engage between orders—and gives you visibility into their consumption patterns.

**"We're focused on retail expansion right now"**
> That's the perfect moment. In retail, you lose the customer relationship to the store. A QR on the bag is how you recapture it.

**"What's the ROI?"**
> Model shows 125-400% return depending on activation rate. At your retention rates, even a 2-3% lift in reorders covers the cost multiple times over.

**"Who else is doing this?"**
> We're in design partner phase. The model is proven in human health apps. You'd be shaping what this becomes for cat food.
