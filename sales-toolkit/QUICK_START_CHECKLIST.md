**Week 2:**
- [ ] Follow up on Week 1 sends (Email 2)
- [ ] Send Email 1 to 3 more brands (Tier 1 or Tier 2)

**Week 3:**
- [ ] Follow up on Week 1 sends (Email 3 if no response)
- [ ] Follow up on Week 2 sends (Email 2)
- [ ] Send Email 1 to 3 more brands

**Week 4:**
- [ ] Send break-up emails (Email 4) to Week 1 non-responders

## Success Metrics to Track

Create a simple spreadsheet with these columns:

| Brand | Contact | Email | Status | Email 1 | Email 2 | Email 3 | Email 4 | Demo | Pilot |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|-------|
| Smalls | John Doe | john@smalls.com | Email 2 Sent | 1/15 | 1/18 | - | - | - | - |

**Track these metrics:**
- Outreach sent (target: 15 in 4 weeks)
- Reply rate (target: 20%+)
- Demo calls booked (target: 10%+)
- Pilots signed (target: 3 in 90 days)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- [ ] **Don't send generic emails.** Always personalize with brand-specific details.
- [ ] **Don't forget to follow up.** 80% of sales happen after the 5th touch. Most people quit after 1.
- [ ] **Don't oversell.** Keep emails short. Goal is to get a reply, not close the deal via email.
- [ ] **Don't ghost responders.** Reply within 24 hours (ideally within 1 hour).
- [ ] **Don't skip calendar reminders.** You'll forget to follow up. Automation is your friend.

## If You're Stuck

**"I don't know who to email at the brand"**
→ Start with CEO/Founder for small brands (<50 employees), Head of Growth or CMO for larger brands. Worst case: info@company.com with "Please forward to the right person."

**"I can't find their email address"**
→ Try Hunter.io, RocketReach, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator. If all else fails, message them on LinkedIn: "Hey [Name], I have something relevant for [Brand]. What's the best email to send it to?"

**"I sent emails but got no response"**
→ Normal. 80% won't respond. Keep following up. Try different subject lines. Send a Loom. Eventually, the right person at the right time will respond.

**"They want a demo but I don't have the app built yet"**
→ Show mockups, wireframes, or a competitor's app as a stand-in. Say: "This is the concept. Your version would be fully white-labeled with your branding. Let me show you how the customer journey works."

**"They're asking for case studies I don't have"**
→ Be honest: "We're in design partner phase. You'd be co-creating the case study. That's why the pilot terms are so aggressive—we're subsidizing the cost to prove the model with premium brands like yours."
