## Scenario 1: Conservative

### Monthly Metrics
- **Activations:** 10,000 × 3% = 300 activations
- **Activation Cost:** 300 × $5 = **$1,500**

### Annual Impact
- **Total Activations:** 300 × 12 = 3,600 customers with app
- **Incremental Reorders:** 3,600 × 10% lift = 360 additional orders/year
- **Incremental Revenue:** 360 × $60 = **$21,600**

### Annual ROI
- **Cost:** $1,500 × 12 = $18,000
- **Revenue Gain:** $21,600
- **Net Gain:** **$3,600** (20% ROI)

**Plus:** Engagement data on 3,600 customers, direct reorder channel, retention insights

---

## Scenario 2: Moderate (Base Case)

### Monthly Metrics
- **Activations:** 10,000 × 5% = 500 activations
- **Activation Cost:** 500 × $4 = **$2,000**

### Annual Impact
- **Total Activations:** 500 × 12 = 6,000 customers with app
- **Incremental Reorders:** 6,000 × 15% lift = 900 additional orders/year
- **Incremental Revenue:** 900 × $60 = **$54,000**

### Annual ROI
- **Cost:** $2,000 × 12 = $24,000
- **Revenue Gain:** $54,000
- **Net Gain:** **$30,000** (125% ROI)

**Plus:** Engagement data on 6,000 customers, direct reorder channel, retention insights

---

## Scenario 3: Aggressive

### Monthly Metrics
- **Activations:** 10,000 × 8% = 800 activations
- **Activation Cost:** 800 × $3 = **$2,400**

### Annual Impact
- **Total Activations:** 800 × 12 = 9,600 customers with app
- **Incremental Reorders:** 9,600 × 25% lift = 2,400 additional orders/year
- **Incremental Revenue:** 2,400 × $60 = **$144,000**

### Annual ROI
- **Cost:** $2,400 × 12 = $28,800
- **Revenue Gain:** $144,000
- **Net Gain:** **$115,200** (400% ROI)

**Plus:** Engagement data on 9,600 customers, direct reorder channel, retention insights

## Additional Value Not Quantified

- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Engaged customers reorder more frequently (20-30% higher LTV)
- **Retention Intelligence:** Identify at-risk customers before they churn
- **Reduced CAC:** Direct reorder channel reduces reliance on paid acquisition
- **Competitive Moat:** Branded app creates switching costs for customers
- **Market Positioning:** Premium brands deserve premium customer experience

---

## Pilot Economics (90 Days)

**Design Partner Terms:**
- $0 setup fee
- Per-activation fee only: $2-5 per activation
- Example: 500 activations over 90 days = $1,000-2,500 total pilot cost
- If 15% reorder lift, ROI positive within pilot period

**Walk away if it doesn't work. Scale if it does.**
