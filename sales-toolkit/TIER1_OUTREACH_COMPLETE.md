# BRAND 1: SMALLS

**Priority:** Highest (DTC pure-play, $40M Series B, cat-only)

## Hook Angles

1. **Mud Bay Expansion** (60+ retail stores) — "In retail, you lose customer data"
2. **95% 2-to-3yr retention** — "What about the 5%?"
3. **Mars/General Mills investors** — Growth pressure = need differentiation

## Email 1: CEO (Matt Michaelson)

**Subject:** 80% retention is great. What about the 20%?

---

Hi Matt,

Saw your Mud Bay expansion hit 60+ stores in the Pacific Northwest. That's a big bet on retail for a DTC-native brand.

Here's what I've been thinking about: You've built something rare—95% of your 2-year customers stick around at the 3-year mark. Most subscription brands would kill for those numbers.

But what about the other 5%? Or the customers who churn in year one? Right now, once that box leaves your fulfillment center, you're essentially blind until they reorder (or don't).

**We built something for this exact gap.**

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers scan, track their cat's weight, and get smart reorder reminders tied to actual consumption—not arbitrary subscription cycles. Every reorder flows through your affiliate link.

Think of it as turning every Smalls bag into an ongoing customer relationship instead of a one-way delivery.

We're selecting 3 premium brands for our design partner program in Q1. Given your retention numbers and the retail expansion, Smalls seems like the obvious fit.

**Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?**

[CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — Design partners get $0 setup and pay only per app activation. We're closing selection by end of January. Farmer's Dog is watching this space—figured you'd want first mover advantage in cat.

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** "Quick bump. Core insight: You're spending to acquire customers, then losing visibility until they hopefully reorder. What if every Smalls bag became a retention tool?"

**Day 7:** "Different angle: In DTC, you own the customer relationship. In retail (Mud Bay), the store owns it. QR on the bag recaptures that relationship."

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop. $0 setup, per-activation pricing, 90-day pilot. Walk away if it doesn't work. Holding spot through Friday."

# BRAND 2: OPEN FARM

**Priority:** High (B-Corp, $65M Series C, weight management line)
**Why:** General Atlantic backing = aggressive growth. B-Corp = health credibility.

**Company:** Toronto HQ, 68-126 employees
**Funding:** $65M+ (General Atlantic led)

## Hook Angles

1. **Weight Management Product** — "Homestead Turkey & Chicken (weight management)"
2. **B-Corp Certification** — Health/transparency credibility
3. **5,500 retail partners** — Same retail data gap problem

## Email 1: Co-CEO

**Subject:** Weight management claims need weight data

---

Hi Jacqueline,

Open Farm's Homestead Turkey & Chicken recipe claims to support weight management. But how do you know if it's actually working?

Right now, customers buy the food, feed their cats, and you never hear from them until the next order. Maybe they lose weight. Maybe they don't. You're trusting that your product works without any feedback loop.

**What if you could prove it?**

We built a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers scan, track their cat's weight weekly, and you get aggregated data showing actual weight outcomes. Plus, they get smart reorder reminders tied to consumption—driving repeat purchases through your affiliate link.

For a B-Corp built on transparency and health claims, this is the obvious next step: prove your products work with real data.

We're selecting 3 brands for our design partner program in Q1. Open Farm—with your weight management line and health positioning—would be the anchor partner.

**Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?**

[CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — Design partners get $0 setup and pay only per activation. You'd be the first B-Corp in the program.

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** "Quick follow-up. Your weight management claims would be 10x stronger with actual outcome data. This is how you get it."

**Day 7:** "Different angle: You have 5,500 retail partners. In retail, you lose the customer relationship. QR activation recaptures it—DTC or retail, same engagement."

**Day 14:** "Last note. Finalizing design partners this week. Given your weight management line, Open Farm would be the anchor. Let me know if you want in."

# BRAND 3: NULO

**Priority:** High (Founded to address pet obesity, dedicated weight line)
**Why:** Founder started company specifically for this problem. Perfect mission alignment.

| VP Marketing | [Research needed] | [Research needed] | Search company page |

**Company:** Austin TX, $28-50M funded (Apax, CAVU)
**Unique:** Founded by All-American swimmer who identified pet obesity as market opportunity

## Hook Angles

1. **MedalSeries Weight Management** — Dedicated product line
2. **Founder Story** — "Founded to address pet obesity"
3. **Low-glycemic, patented probiotics** — Science-forward credibility

## Email 1: Founder/CEO (Michael Landa)

**Subject:** You built Nulo to solve pet obesity. We built the feedback loop.

---

Hi Michael,

I read that you founded Nulo specifically to address the pet obesity epidemic—after seeing it firsthand as an All-American swimmer who cared about nutrition.

That mission resonates. You built the food. But once it leaves your facility, you have no idea if it's actually working.

**We built the other half.**

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your MedalSeries Weight Management bags. Customers scan, track their cat's weight weekly, and get smart reorder reminders. You get aggregated outcome data proving your products work—and repeat purchases flowing through your affiliate link.

This isn't about marketing. This is about closing the loop on the mission you started with: actually solving pet obesity, one tracked weight at a time.

We're selecting 3 brands for our design partner program. Given Nulo's founding story and the MedalSeries line, you're the obvious choice.

**15 minutes to see how it works?**

[CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — No setup fee for design partners. Per-activation pricing only. 90-day pilot. If it doesn't prove out, you walk away.

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** "Quick bump. The MedalSeries Weight Management line + outcome tracking = category leadership."

**Day 7:** "Different thought: Your competitors are selling food. You could be selling outcomes—with data to prove it."

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop. Finalizing design partners. You founded Nulo to solve pet obesity. This is how you prove it's working."

# BRAND 4: RAISED RIGHT

**Priority:** High (Family-owned, vet partnerships, DTC)
**Why:** Dr. Karen Becker partnership = credibility. Family-owned = fast decisions.

| Vet Advisor | Dr. Karen Becker | [via Raised Right] | Search "Dr. Karen Becker" |

**Company:** Rye NY, family-owned
**Unique:** Veterinarian-formulated, human-grade, Dr. Becker partnership

## Hook Angles

1. **Dr. Karen Becker partnership** — Vet credibility for health claims
2. **Family-owned** — Fast decision-making, no corporate bureaucracy
3. **DTC subscription** — Perfect fit for engagement tools

## Email 1: Founder

**Subject:** Dr. Becker's recipes + weight tracking = vet credibility on steroids

---

Hi [FOUNDER_NAME],

Raised Right has something most cat food brands don't: veterinarian formulation from Dr. Karen Becker. That's real credibility in a space full of marketing claims.

But here's the gap: When a customer buys Raised Right for their cat's health, you have no idea if it's working. They might lose weight. They might not. You're trusting the product without any feedback.

**What if you could prove it?**

We built a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers scan, track their cat's weight weekly, and get reorder reminders tied to actual consumption. You get aggregated outcome data—turning Dr. Becker's formulations into verified results.

For a brand built on veterinarian credibility, this is the obvious next step: outcome data to back up the claims.

We're selecting 3 brands for our design partner program. Raised Right's vet partnership makes you the ideal fit.

**Worth 15 minutes?**

[CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — $0 setup for design partners. You'd only pay per activation during the 90-day pilot.

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** "Quick follow-up. Vet-formulated + outcome tracking = category leadership for health-conscious cat owners."

**Day 7:** "Different angle: As a family business, you can move faster than the big brands. This is how you get ahead while they're still in committee meetings."

**Day 14:** "Last note. Finalizing partners this week. Dr. Becker's credibility + outcome data would be a powerful combination."

# BRAND 5: WERUVA

**Priority:** High (Family-owned, Cat Person acquisition, international)
**Why:** Recent DTC expansion (Cat Person) shows digital strategy. Family = fast decisions.

**Company:** Natick MA, ~73 employees, $35M revenue
**Unique:** Cat Person acquisition (DTC brand) shows digital growth strategy

## Hook Angles

1. **Cat Person acquisition** — Shows commitment to digital/DTC
2. **Family-owned** — Fast decisions, long-term thinking
3. **International presence** — 5 countries, scalable partnership

## Email 1: Co-Founder (David Forman)

**Subject:** You bought Cat Person. What's next?

---

Hi David,

The Cat Person acquisition caught my attention. Weruva buying a DTC brand signals you're thinking about digital customer relationships, not just product distribution.

**Here's the natural next step.**

We built a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging—Weruva, Cat Person, all your brands. Customers scan, track their cat's weight, and get smart reorder reminders. Every purchase flows back through your affiliate link.

You're already thinking DTC with Cat Person. This extends that thinking to every bag you sell—retail or direct.

We're selecting 3 brands for our design partner program in Q1. Given the Cat Person move and Weruva's family-owned agility, you could move on this faster than anyone else.

**15 minutes to see how it works?**

P.S. — Design partners get $0 setup. Per-activation pricing only. 90-day pilot with walk-away terms.

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** "Quick bump. The Cat Person acquisition was smart. This is the engagement layer that makes it even smarter."

**Day 7:** "Different thought: Family-owned brands can move faster than PE-backed competitors. This is how you get ahead while they're still getting approvals."

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop. Finalizing design partners. Weruva's DTC ambitions + our engagement platform = category leadership."
