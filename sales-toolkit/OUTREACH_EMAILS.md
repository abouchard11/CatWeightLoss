# Outreach Email Sequence: Smalls

---

## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject:** Smalls customers want to stay connected between orders

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: What happens after a Smalls customer receives their delivery?

They feed their cat, the food runs out in 3-4 weeks, and you hope they remember to reorder. No touchpoint. No engagement data. No direct path back to you.

**We built something for this.**

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers track their cat's weight, get reorder reminders, and buy again via your affiliate link.

One QR code = ongoing relationship + reorder attribution.

We're launching design partner pilots with 3 premium brands. Smalls seems like the perfect fit.

**Available for a 15-minute demo this week?**

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — $0 setup fee for design partners. You'd pay only per activation during the 90-day pilot.

## Email 2: Follow-Up Bump (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Smalls customers want to stay connected between orders

[FIRST_NAME],

Circling back on this.

The core insight: You're spending $50-150 to acquire each customer, then losing contact until they hopefully reorder.

**What if every bag became a customer engagement tool?**

That's what we're doing with premium pet food brands. White-label app. QR on packaging. Weight tracking. Reorder attribution.

I put together a one-pager that shows how this works: [LINK TO ONE_PAGER]

**Worth 15 minutes to explore?**

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Email 3: Different Angle - Competitive Intelligence (Day 7)

**Subject:** How Smalls could own the customer experience end-to-end

[FIRST_NAME],

I've been thinking about Smalls' position in the premium cat food space.

You're competing with brands that are increasingly building direct customer relationships through apps and subscription platforms. But most of those solutions require customers to download an app *before* they've even tried the product.

**That's backwards.**

What if the app came *with* the product? They buy Smalls, scan the QR on the bag, and now they have your branded app for tracking weight and reordering.

No customer acquisition cost for the app. No friction. Just value.

**Three brands are piloting this in Q1. Interested in being one of them?**

I can show you the economics on a quick call.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — The ROI model shows 125-400% return depending on activation and reorder lift rates. Happy to walk through your specific numbers.

## Email 4: Break-Up Email (Day 14)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

[FIRST_NAME],

I'll take your silence as "not the right time."

Before I close the loop: We're finalizing design partner selection this week. If Smalls wants in, now's the moment.

**What we're offering:**
- $0 setup fee (waived for design partners)
- White-label iOS app with your branding
- Per-activation pricing only ($2-5 per activation)
- 90-day pilot to prove reorder lift
- Walk away if it doesn't work

**What we need:**
- 1-3 SKUs with QR codes
- 90 days to prove the model

If this isn't a fit, totally understood. If you want to explore it, I'll hold a design partner slot through Friday.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — If the timing is just off but you're interested later, let me know. I'll circle back in Q2.
