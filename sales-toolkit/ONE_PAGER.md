# Turn Every Bag Into a Customer Relationship

## The Problem You're Solving

Premium pet food brands spend $50-150 acquiring a customer, then lose contact until the next purchase. No engagement. No data. No direct reorder path.

**You ship bags. They disappear into homes. You guess when they'll reorder.**

---

## The Solution: Your Brand in Their Pocket

White-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging.

### How It Works

```
Customer receives bag → Scans QR → Downloads YOUR branded app →
Tracks pet's weight → Gets reorder reminder → Buys direct via affiliate link
```

**One QR code. Ongoing relationship.**
