## Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** 80% retention is great. What about the 20%?

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Saw your Mud Bay expansion hit 60+ stores in the Pacific Northwest. That's a big bet on retail for a DTC-native brand.

Here's what I've been thinking about: You've built something rare—95% of your 2-year customers stick around at the 3-year mark. Most subscription brands would kill for those numbers.

But what about the other 5%? Or the customers who churn in year one? Right now, once that box leaves your fulfillment center, you're essentially blind until they reorder (or don't).

**We built something for this exact gap.**

It's a white-label iOS app that activates via QR code on your packaging. Customers scan, track their cat's weight, and get smart reorder reminders tied to actual consumption—not arbitrary subscription cycles. Every reorder flows through your affiliate link.

Think of it as turning every Smalls bag into an ongoing customer relationship instead of a one-way delivery.

We're selecting 3 premium brands for our design partner program in Q1. Given your retention numbers and the retail expansion, Smalls seems like the obvious fit.

**Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?**

[CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. — Design partners get $0 setup and pay only per app activation. We're closing selection by [DATE]. Farmer's Dog is watching this space—figured you'd want first mover advantage in cat.

## Research Notes (for personalization)

### Company Intel
- **Founded:** 2017 by Matt Michaelson and Calvin Bohn
- **Total Funding:** $34M (Series B closed March 2023 at $19M)
- **Investors:** Left Lane Capital, Companion Fund (Mars-affiliated), 301 INC (General Mills), Valor Capital
- **Scale:** 8-figures revenue, 100,000+ cats fed, ~50 employees (as of 2023)

### Recent News
- **October 2025:** Launched in 60+ Mud Bay stores (Pacific Northwest retail expansion)
- **September 2025:** Hired Nate Kredich as COO to oversee retail expansion
- **Now sold in 700+ retail outlets nationwide**

### Retention Data (use these stats)
- 80% customer retention rate (2024)
- 95% of 2-year customers remain at 3-year mark (near-zero long-tail churn)
- CEO quote: "retention is not correlated to income"

### Competitive Landscape
- Primary comp: The Farmer's Dog (but they don't do cat food)
- Cat-specific competitors: Cat Person, Ziggy, Made by Nacho, KatKin
- Same investor (Left Lane Capital) invested in both Smalls and The Farmer's Dog
- Market gap: CEO noted surprise that "we're still really alone in bringing fresh food to the category"

### Digital Presence
- No dedicated mobile app (web-only subscription management)
- Uses Bitly QR codes for marketing campaigns (familiar with QR → action flow)
- DTC-first model, now expanding to retail

### Key Angles to Emphasize
1. **Retail expansion = loss of customer data visibility** — When you sell through Mud Bay, you lose the direct relationship
2. **No mobile app = opportunity** — Competitors will eventually build this
3. **QR familiarity** — They already use Bitly QR codes for marketing, so the scan-to-app concept won't feel foreign
4. **Cat-first positioning** — Align with their identity as the cat-only brand (vs. dog brands that also do cat)

## Alternative Subject Lines (A/B test)

1. "80% retention is great. What about the 20%?"
2. "Mud Bay is exciting. Here's what comes next."
3. "The Farmer's Dog doesn't do cat. That's your window."
4. "What happens between Smalls deliveries?"
5. "Your retail expansion just created a data gap"

## Follow-Up Sequence (if no response)

**Day 3 - Bump:**
> Subject: Re: 80% retention is great. What about the 20%?
>
> [FIRST_NAME] — Quick bump on this. The core insight: You're spending to acquire customers, then losing visibility until they hopefully reorder.
>
> What if every Smalls bag became a retention tool?
>
> Here's the one-pager: [LINK]
>
> 15 minutes?

**Day 7 - Different angle:**
> Subject: Retail expansion creates a customer data gap
>
> [FIRST_NAME] — I've been thinking about Smalls' Mud Bay launch.
>
> In DTC, you own the customer relationship. In retail, Mud Bay owns it. The customer buys Smalls, but you have no idea who they are or when they'll buy again.
>
> What if every bag—DTC or retail—connected customers directly to your brand via a QR code?
>
> That's what we're building. Three brands are piloting in Q1.
>
> Interested in being the cat-first brand that owns this space?

**Day 14 - Break-up:**
> Subject: Closing the loop on Smalls
>
> [FIRST_NAME] — I'll take the silence as "not the right time."
>
> Before I close the loop: We're finalizing design partner selection this week. Smalls would be the first cat-focused brand in the program.
>
> $0 setup. Per-activation pricing. 90-day pilot. Walk away if it doesn't work.
>
> If this isn't a fit, totally understood. If you want to explore, I'll hold a spot through Friday.

## Objection Handling Prep

**"We already have strong retention"**
> That's exactly why this works. You've proven customers love Smalls. This just gives them a reason to engage between orders—and gives you visibility into their consumption patterns. Think of it as retention insurance for your best customers.

**"We're focused on retail expansion right now"**
> That's actually the perfect moment. In retail, you lose the customer relationship to the store. A QR on the bag is how you recapture it—whether they buy from Mud Bay or your site, they still scan and join your ecosystem.

**"What's the ROI?"**
> Model shows 125-400% return depending on activation rate. Happy to walk through your specific numbers. At your retention rates, even a 2-3% lift in reorders covers the cost multiple times over.

**"Who else is doing this?"**
> We're in design partner phase—that's why the terms are aggressive. The model is proven in human health apps (MyFitnessPal, Noom). We're adapting it for premium pet food. You'd be shaping what this becomes for the category.
