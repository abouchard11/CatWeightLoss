## Script with Timing

### [0:00-0:08] Hook & Problem (8 seconds)

**Show:** Your face on camera

**Say:**
"Hey [FIRST_NAME], this is [YOUR_NAME]. Quick question: what happens after your customer receives their cat food delivery? Usually... nothing. Until they hopefully remember to reorder. Let me show you how to fix that."

**Timing note:** Speak at normal conversational pace, not rushed.

---

### [0:08-0:18] The Trigger (10 seconds)

**Show:** QR code on cat food packaging (mockup or actual)

**Say:**
"Here's how it works. Your customer receives their bag, and right on the packaging is a QR code. They scan it..."

**Action:** Show phone scanning QR code (transition to iPhone screen)

**Say (continued):**
"...and this happens."

---

### [0:18-0:28] App Activation (10 seconds)

**Show:** App download/install screen → Brand-customized welcome screen

**Say:**
"They download YOUR branded app. Not ours. Yours. Custom logo, custom colors, your brand experience."

**Action:** Show app opening with [BRAND_NAME] branding clearly visible

**Say (continued):**
"Now they're in."

**Timing note:** Let the visuals do the work here. Don't over-explain.

---

### [0:28-0:43] Core Value (15 seconds)

**Show:** Quickly navigate through app screens (pet profile → weight tracker → progress chart)

**Say:**
"They create their cat's profile, track weight over time, and get reminders when it's time to reorder."

**Action:** Tap to "Reorder Now" screen showing product + affiliate link

**Say (continued):**
"When they're ready to buy, boom—one tap takes them directly to YOUR checkout. You get the attribution. You get the data. You own the relationship."

**Timing note:** This is the core value prop. Be clear and confident.

---

### [0:43-0:55] Business Case (12 seconds)

**Show:** Screen with ROI summary (can be a slide or just your face + overlay text)

**Say:**
"Here's what this means for your business. If 5% of your customers activate this, and it lifts reorders by just 15%, you're looking at 6-figure annual revenue impact. And you're paying only per activation—no upfront cost."

**Timing note:** Reference their specific numbers if you have them.

---

### [0:55-1:00] Call to Action (5 seconds)

**Show:** Your face on camera

**Say:**
"We're launching pilot programs with three premium brands this quarter. If you want to be one of them, just reply to this email. Happy to walk through the numbers with you."

**Smile, pause for 1 second, then end recording.**

---

## Alternative Endings (Choose Based on Context)

### If you've already had initial conversation:

**[0:55-1:00]**
"That's the overview. When should we jump on a call to walk through pilot terms and economics? I'm free [DAY] or [DAY]."

### If you're sending cold:

**[0:55-1:00]**
"If this looks interesting, reply with 'yes' and I'll send you the one-pager with pilot terms. Otherwise, no worries—I'll follow up in a few days."

### If you're responding to specific objection:

**[0:55-1:00]**
"You mentioned [SPECIFIC_CONCERN]. This solves that by [SOLUTION]. Let's talk through how this would work for [BRAND_NAME] specifically."

## Post-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Trim any dead air at beginning/end
- [ ] Add text overlay at 0:43 with ROI numbers (optional but effective)
- [ ] Verify brand name is visible in app screens
- [ ] Check audio quality (no echo, clear voice)
- [ ] Test playback at 1.5x speed (viewers will do this)
- [ ] Add custom Loom thumbnail (your face + "60-second demo for [BRAND]")
- [ ] Add Loom CTA button: "Book 15-Min Call" → [CALENDAR_LINK]

---

## Loom Settings Recommendations

**Privacy:** Unlisted (not public)
**Expiration:** 90 days (creates urgency)
**Call-to-Action:** "Book a Demo" → Link to your calendar
**Emoji Reactions:** Enabled (lets you see engagement)
**Viewer Info:** Enabled (see who watched, for how long)

---

## Follow-Up Based on Loom Analytics

**If they watch <25%:**
- Not interested or too busy
- Follow-up angle: "Too long? Here's the 10-second version: QR code → branded app → reorder attribution. Worth 15 minutes?"

**If they watch 25-75%:**
- Interested but not convinced
- Follow-up angle: "Saw you checked out the demo. Which part do you want to dig into? Economics? Technical implementation? Timeline?"

**If they watch >75% but don't reply:**
- Very interested but hesitating
- Follow-up angle: "Saw you watched the full demo. What questions can I answer? Or should I just send over the pilot LOI so you can see the terms?"

**If they watch 100% multiple times:**
- Extremely interested, probably sharing internally
- Follow-up angle: "Noticed you've reviewed this a few times. Are you sharing it internally? Happy to jump on a call with your team to answer questions."

## Script Variations for Different Brands

### For Subscription Brands (Smalls, NomNom):

Adjust [0:43-0:55] business case to:
"Here's what this means for your subscription business. Instead of hoping customers remember to reorder, you're putting your brand in their pocket. We see 20-30% higher retention rates when customers have an engagement layer between deliveries."

### For Retail/Amazon Brands (Nulo, Open Farm):

Adjust [0:43-0:55] business case to:
"Here's the opportunity. Right now, your customers buy you on Amazon or at Petco, and you have zero relationship with them. This gives you a direct line. Their next purchase can come through your affiliate link instead of through Amazon. You're building a DTC channel off your retail distribution."

### For New/Small Brands:

Adjust [0:43-0:55] business case to:
"Here's the advantage. Bigger brands can afford to build custom apps. You can't—until now. This gives you the same customer engagement tools as the big players, for a fraction of the cost. And you pay only when it works."

## Advanced Tips

**Personalization at Scale:**
- Record the core demo (0:08-0:55) once
- Record custom intros (0:00-0:08) and outros (0:55-1:00) for each brand
- Use Loom's "Trim & Stitch" feature to combine

**A/B Testing:**
- Test "face + screen" vs. "screen only" to see which gets better completion rates
- Test different hooks in first 8 seconds
- Track which versions lead to demo calls

**Internal Use:**
- Record a 3-minute "extended version" with more detail for prospects who want to see more
- Create a "technical FAQ" version for engineering/product teams at brands
- Make a "founder story" version explaining why you built this

**Ready to record? Run through the script 2-3 times out loud before hitting record. You'll sound more natural and hit the timing better.**
